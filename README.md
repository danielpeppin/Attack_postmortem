# Forensic Analysis

Forensic analysis of packet captures to find probably sequence of events during simulated attack

2 sets of packet captures
- baseline traffic
- traffic during attack

Tools for analysis
- Splunk

Since no alerts are in place, we will compare attack traffic to baseline traffic to find discrepancies.

We will start with the attack traffic to find traffic that looks suspicious. We will then look to see if this traffic is in fact anomalous.

### Suspicious Traffic 1




### Suspicious Traffic 2



### Suspicious Traffic 3
